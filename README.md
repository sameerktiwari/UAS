This project is aimed at developing a University Admission System Application for admissions. This is a web based application that can be accessed over the web. This system can be used for applying to programs scheduled and enroll a student for a program scheduled. This is an integrated system that contains three user components, Admin component, Member of Admission Committee(MAC) component and Applicant component.
